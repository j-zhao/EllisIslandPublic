## Overview
Vertafore Ellis Island is a [Lambda Architecture](http://lambda-architecture.net/) based data platform to store and access large amounts of real time and historical data or files through Vertafore's Hadoop environment.  Besides being able to process and store the high volume and throughput of data, Ellis Island provides API's to access stored data through various tools and services.  In addition to handling bulk data processes, Ellis Island also supports real-time update and ingestion.

## Purpose
In 2014, Vertafore Enterprise Analytics adopted Hadoop as a multi-purpose infrastructure to handle various data-driven features and products.  In the spirit of sharing this resource across the organization, we developed Vertafore Ellis Island to meet the growing demands and complications that is a part of storing and processing high volumes of data.

Initially serving the back-end for data storage and processing for Carrier Analytics, we've been approached by many teams around the organization regarding their own questions and discussions that come with developing data-driven products.  Ellis Island serves to bridge dev teams with our infrastructure by providing an entry point to write data as well as an access point for consumption of said data.  With a REST API at both ends of Ellis Island, users can write and consume their own data without worrying about the overhead and storage expenses.  You feed us data, we do the rest.
